# Odd-Checker
Allows you to choose an operator (+,-,/,*) then creates random numbers in a loop executing the chosen operator on the random number until an odd number is produced.
It will then stop the code and tell you how many times it used the operator before reaching the odd number as well as tell you what the odd number is that stopped the loop.

This is part of my Java learning Journey.
